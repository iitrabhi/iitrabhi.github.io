Hi there, and welcome to my newsletter.

For the longest time, I have been thinking of starting a newsletter. It is a part of a more significant project that I have embarked on, i.e., to establish better systems for increased productivity. I truly believe that sharing our knowledge helps us better understand the subject. I hope this newsletter will become a medium to craft my thoughts for the world.

**My goals with this newsletter are as follows:**

- Build a consistent writing habit.
- Learn to distill ideas into small understandable articles.
- Share my weekly findings on research and productivity with the world.

It is easy to become an information hoarder, and I have done this a lot. I have to convert the stored information into a coherent document to derive any benefit from it. With a newsletter every Sunday, I can sit and go through all of the stuff of that week and create a good document that would be useful to me and might help someone trying to achieve the same goals as me.

**Here’s what you can expect from me every week.**

- A simple animation of an idea summarizes a quote from the book I am reading on productivity and research.
- Tip of the week for producing quality research.
- Websites and application recommendations for quality research.
- Anything else that I find interesting in the field of computational mechanics.

The whole idea of this newsletter and [my website](http://abhigupta.io/) is to share ideas that will help other researchers accelerate their research output.

That’s it for today. I will see you next week.
