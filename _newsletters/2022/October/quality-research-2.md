Hi, and welcome to _Quality Research_,

I recently discovered an AI tool named [Galactica](https://galactica.org/?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that is capable of generating original scientific documents. I was impressed by its results and shared them on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6998964084712878081/?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). This led me to look into other tools that could help researchers produce quality research, and I will share my discoveries next week. 

This week I released an updated version of my Ph.D. essentials guide on Gumroad [[link](https://abhigupta.gumroad.com/l/phd-essentials?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)].

**Here is one tool, productivity tip, and presentation guide for you this week.**

-   **Tool - cmder**: It is the first app I install on a new system [[link](https://cmder.app/?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)]. CMDER is a free, portable console emulator for Windows. It is an excellent utility for researchers who use the terminal extensively in their workflow. It supports code highlights, tabs, and keyboard shortcuts and has multiple handy features that make it easy to work. If you are still relying on GUI for research, I recommend learning the basics of the terminal [[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)].
-   **Productivity tip:** Getting things done (GTD) philosophy from David Allen has been a game changer for my productivity. Read [this article](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to understand how to implement this system within a to-do app. I also highly recommend reading the book [[link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)].
-   **Presentation guide:** Graphs, figures, and tables form the skeleton of your research article, yet only a few researchers spend time formatting them carefully. Read [this article](https://abhigupta.io/2022/07/20/pdf-plot-python-matplotlib.html?utm_campaign=Quality%20Research&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to understand the rules for creating production-ready plots.

That’s it for today; I will see you next week.
