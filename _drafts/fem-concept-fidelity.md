The intention of computer simulation is to simulate the reallity as closely as possible. The primary motivation to have a good simulation is to predict the behaviour of the system and then design it as per our requirements.

The dictionary definition of fidelity is *the degree of exactness with which something is reproduced*. With computer based simulation fidelity represents the accuracy of simulation results when compared to the real world. High fidelity models results in better accuracy in simulation but at a significant computational cost.
