Throughout my life, I have not paid much attention to personal finance. I'm a scientist by heart and profession, and I used to be focused on my science work. I thought that finance would take care of itself; Boy, was I wrong.

This is because our intuition is built around linear thinking. We put in X effort and get returns directly proportional to it. The concept of exponential growth and its effects can be challenging for humans to comprehend, especially over long periods. Even brilliant people like Albert Einstein found this kind of growth excellent and called it the "eighth wonder of the world." 

Recently, a good friend encouraged me to explore mutual funds, focusing on how they can lead to exponential growth. This got me interested in the topic.

## What do you want to do with your money?
The obvious answer is that you would like it to grow. Suppose you have ₹5000 in your account. You would feel happy if it grows to, let's say, ₹10,000 in a few years. You need to grasp a few simple investment concepts to understand how that can happen. For the sake of simplicity, I am leaving out inflation in this post.

I will start with a few terms from banking, as that is what I have seen in my house, and I believe most Indian families do the same; they keep most of their money in savings accounts of fixed deposits.

- **Principal Amount**: The principal amount refers to the initial sum of money we have to invest, in this case, ₹5000.
- **Interest**: In investment, interest refers to the earnings or returns generated on the principal amount. It represents the additional value gained from the investment over time. In this case, we want ₹5000.
- **Compounding:** The power of compounding involves earning returns on your initial investment and the accumulated interest or gains. Over time, this can lead to exponential growth.





## What exactly is a mutual fund?

Mutual funds are investments where many people pool their money to buy a mix of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Over time, the value of these investments can grow, and when you reinvest any earnings (like dividends or interest), your money can start to grow faster and faster.

> Mutual funds are designed for long-term growth and investing. They aim to generate higher returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.
