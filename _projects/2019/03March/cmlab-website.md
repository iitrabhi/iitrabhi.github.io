As the team at the lab was growing, there was a need for sharing the lab's resources in one place. The other requirement was to have a good onboarding experience for the new people joining the lab and have a set of guidelines for those who wish to join the lab. Thus, I made this [website](https://computationalmechanics.in/) in WordPress. All of the resources of the lab are shared here.

Since launch of the website, 10 new people joined our lab and had a good on-boarding experience. Most of them completed the full on-boarding process in less than a week. That included completion of all the courses on the [resources page](https://computationalmechanics.in/resources/) along with installation of all the softwares required for research.
