## [**FEniCS**](https://fenicsproject.org/)
It's an awesome open-source package to solve differential equations using the finite element method. I was lucky enough to get accepted in the google summer of code to work on the mesh processing pipeline in the new version of FEniCS, tag named FEniCS-X. You can find more about my experience [here](https://computationalmechanics.in/fenics-the-mesh-workflow/). I was also interview by numfocus during GSoC and you can find that [here](https://numfocus.org/blog/meet-our-2019-gsoc-students-part-1). The output of the program is mentioned on the google-summer-of-code website [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4659097339691008).
