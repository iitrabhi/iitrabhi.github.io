## [55 Line topology optimization code](https://github.com/iitrabhi/topo-fenics): 

Even before starting my PhD, I had a strong inclination towards python and had a desire to do my work using only opensource environment. Fortunately, I found FEniCS, while searching for some documentation on PETSc. It has best of both worlds, the speed of C++ and the ease of python. I had a strong belief that coding the topology optimization problem in FEniCS could result in a highly readable code as opposed to other existing implementations. This resulted in the development of the smallest code for 2D+3D parallel implementation of topology optimization-[The 55-line code of topology optimization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347300347_A_55-line_code_for_large-scale_parallel_topology_optimization_in_2D_and_3D).
