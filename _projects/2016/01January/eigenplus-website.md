I learned a lot at NPCIL and wanted to share that information with the world. At the time, I could not find even a single website of civil engineering that was well designed and organized. I could not post on such websites and thus thought of making my own. That led to the creation of [eigenplus.com](https://www.eigenplus.com/).

My core area of interest at the time was eigenvalue analysis. I had just read an article - [The $25 Billion eigenvector - The linear algebra behind Google](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/~bryan/googleFinalVersionFixed.pdf). I was interested in figuring out how something that we use for dynamic analysis of buildings is also used by Google. Thus, I thought of naming the website `eigenplus`, which meant that I would discuss `eigen`value analysis `plus` other things in civil engineering. I knew my little understanding of the subject of eigenvalues and vectors was not sufficient, and thus I had to start with different topics that I was working on at that time.
