I participated in the [SoME one challenge 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_DqwOVr3Vw&feature=emb_title). It was a great experience to make a full video with python in Blender finally. One of the winning entries of the challenge was [this blog post](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/caustics-engineering) on caustics by [Matt Ferraro](). It was the first time that I heard of the term caustics. The blog post is well written, and I love how he has described the problem and the solution. 

Immediately after reading the blog post, I wanted to recreate the analysis portion in FEniCS and use the CNC machine in our lab to create the object. Moreover, after going through the [issues](https://github.com/MattFerraro/causticsEngineering/issues/10), I learned that we could model caustics in Blender. And thus, we can test out different results of the analysis run without even creating the thing in the real world.

The first step was to just run the code and test the generated model in Blender. Here is the 3D model setup. It's crude right now but I did get the results.

The image generated from this experiment is a good first try. The next step is to get a clean image in Blender with the parameters presented in the blog post.
