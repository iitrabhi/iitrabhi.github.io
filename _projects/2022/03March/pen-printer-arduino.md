This has been a long term dream of mine. To move from the digital realm to the physical realm. I would love to code and then watch my creation in the real world. Thus, I have started this project to learn and understand the working of arduino by creating a simple pen printer. Here is the approach

## Digital double

First step is to create a pen printer in Blender as a digital twin of the real thing. This was the easy part. I have to make a simple 3D model in blender with all the components of printer, pen and paper. Then the next step is to setup  constraints on different portion of the model. Setting up constraints is equivalent to attaching different components with motors
