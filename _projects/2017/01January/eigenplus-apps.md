Blogging regularly was difficult for me. I loved to code but not write. So after starting and writing a few blog posts on [eigenplus.com](https://www.eigenplus.com/), I thought of creating an app for android. I could reach millions of people around the globe with my creation. It was soo exciting, and [I developed five apps](https://www.eigenplus.com/civil-engineering-android-apps/). All of my apps have been downloaded by over 500 thousand people, and, have a great rating on the Google play store.
