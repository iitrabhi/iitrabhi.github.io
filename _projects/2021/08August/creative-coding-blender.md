I saw a computer for the first time at my friend's house in class 6 and was instantly hooked to it. We used to play some video games on it. Even though computer classes were started in our school from class 8, we were not taught coding. But, thankfully, we were taught about flowcharts. The teacher was excellent, and he forced us to think about the flow of logic before teaching anything about programming language.

It was not until class 11 that I learned about programming languages. The day I was introduced to programming, I was in love. I could not believe that I had the power to design software that real people could use. The class schedule included the programming language FoxPro. It was a relational database management system. That means that we could play with database's using this language. I and one of my friend joined forces and we decided to make a `Fees management system` for our school as we found many shortcoming in the current manual method of logging in all the information.
