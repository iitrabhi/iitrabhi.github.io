I always had a strong desire to learn to make simple videos of engineering concepts and post that on youtube. Before this I had used `JAVA` to create android apps. But, ever since starting my PhD I have been hooked to `python` and find excuses to use it to create something. It is such a versatile language. When the SoME one challenge was announced by Grant Sanderson on his popular youtube channel `3Blue1Brown` I finally mustered the courage to make my first video. It was a nice experience. Everything was done using python.
