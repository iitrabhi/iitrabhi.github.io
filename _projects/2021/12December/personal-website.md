I have been thinking about developing a simple way to store my daily findings online for a long time. Initially, I have tried to keep them in a notion page, but they are not accessible by my team members. Recently I have found many solutions to my research problems on websites of fellow researchers working in the same field. This has motivated me to document my daily findings online in my blog.

I have created a WordPress-based [website](https://www.computationalmechanics.in/) for my lab, but I donâ€™t want to clutter that with daily posts. Moreover, I find it inconvenient to use the editor provided by WordPress. Daily we work with many formulas and images. It is pretty easy to format them with Markdown on the laptop directly. I have always found it challenging to do the same easy on the online editor. Thus, I have decided to shift my blog to Jekyll. This way, I can easily document in Markdown on my laptop and then, at the end of the day, push that to my website using the same workflow that I use to push my code to GitHub.

The other intention of this website is to learn javascript to make interactive widgets for teaching.
