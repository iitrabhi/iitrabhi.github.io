Welcome to the customer support page for my personal website! I am here to help you with any questions or concerns you may have about your purchases of my digital products on Gumroad.

## Payment Processing

All payments for my digital products are processed through Stripe, a secure and reliable payment processor. If you experience any issues with your payment, please check the following:

- Ensure that the card information you entered is correct, including the card number, expiration date, and security code.
- Make sure that the billing address you entered matches the address associated with your card.
- If you're still having trouble, contact your card issuer to confirm that there are no blocks or holds on your account.

If you've checked all of the above and are still having issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance.

## Digital Product Delivery

After a successful payment, you will receive an email from Gumroad with a link to download your digital product. If you don't receive this email, please check your spam or junk folder. If you still can't find the email, please reach out to us for assistance.
