# Projects

I work as a researcher at the computational mechanic's lab at IIT Roorkee. My core areas of interest are mathematics, computer programming, and art. I have always tried to find creative and aesthetically pleasing solutions to my problems. I code for fun and have developed for desktop, web, and mobile. Here are some of my projects (or that I have contributed to) that I'm proud of.
