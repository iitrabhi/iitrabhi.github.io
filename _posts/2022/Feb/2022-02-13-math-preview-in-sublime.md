## The problem

When working on a LaTeX project in sublime, if I have defined custom commands with the `\newcommand` command, then the math preview of `LaTeXTools` fails to preview them in sublime. I would like to have the full preview of the equations with custom commands in sublime itself.

## The solution

- Install the package [LaTeXYZ](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LaTeXYZ).

- GoTo user prefrences of LaTeXYZ and set the following command to true.

  ```json
  {"auto_set_preview_math_template_preamble": true}
  ```

- GoTo `prefrences` → `Browse Packages` → `LaTeXYZ`→`support`→`Default.sublime-keymap`
- Comment out the full file. This step is necessary because otherwise `LaTeXYZ` would interfere with normal working of `LaTeXtools`.
