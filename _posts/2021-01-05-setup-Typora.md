Typora is my favourite markdown editor. It is opensource, clean and minimal. If you know and understand a little bit about programming in CSS that you can also modify its look to your liking. In this post I am going to show you the exact settings that helped me get as close as possible to the actual look and feel of the Moving theme on the website.

## Installation

- Go to the website and download and install the package: [Typora](https://typora.io/)

- To match the look of the theme you have to install the Bitter font: [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter)

- After the installation of the font is complete you have to download and install the following file to your themes folder. Follow the instructions in the README file. [Gitbook](https://github.com/iitrabhi/typora-gitbook-theme)

  Goto Preferences → Appearance → Open theme folder and then paste the theme files here.

- Once you have pasted the theme you will get the option in the dropdown menu in Preferences → Appearance. Select Gitbook Slate and now you have the layout similar to this![image-20210105104246331](/assets/images/image-20210105104246331.png)

- Next, you have to go to Preferences → Images and use the following settings:

- Next, goto Prefrences → Markdown and check the following options

- The last thing that you need to do now is to goto Format → Image → Check Use Image Root Path.

- Finally whenever you wish to add a new post, just open the root folder of your website from File → Open. Root folder is the folder containing the index.markdown file.
