**Abstract and Introduction: Setting the Stage**
In academic writing, the abstract and introduction sections serve to present the general background and the objectives of the study. These sections are best written in the `present tense` to emphasize the ongoing relevance and immediacy of the research topic. For example:

"This paper examines the effects of X on Y."

**Literature Review: Reflecting on Past Research**
The literature review section discusses previous studies and findings, requiring the use of the `past tense` to acknowledge the work already done in the field. This helps differentiate between existing knowledge and the new contributions of the current study. For instance:

"Gupta (2020) found that X affects Y."

**Methods: Detailing the Research Process**
The methods section outlines the procedures and techniques employed during the study. Here, the `past tense` is used to describe completed actions and established methods. This provides a clear account of the research process for replication and verification. An example sentence might be:

"The samples were analyzed using X method."

**Results: Presenting the Findings**
When writing the results section, the `past tense` is again appropriate, as this part reports the findings of the study. This tense choice helps to clearly convey what was observed and discovered during the research. For example:

"The results showed a significant increase in Y."

**Discussion: Interpreting the Findings**
The discussion section interprets the results and relates them to existing knowledge, often using the `present tense`. This approach underscores the current relevance and implications of the findings, making connections to the broader academic context. An illustrative sentence could be:

"These findings suggest that X plays a crucial role in Y."

**Conclusion: Summarizing the Study**
In the conclusion, the `present tense` is used to summarize the main findings and their significance. This helps reinforce the study's contributions and its relevance to ongoing research. For example:

"This study provides new insights into the relationship between X and Y."

**Choosing the Right Person: Maintaining Objectivity**
Academic writing traditionally favors the `third person` to maintain an objective tone. However, the `first person` may be used sparingly in some sections like the introduction or discussion to highlight the author's contributions. Here is an example of using the first person appropriately:

"In this study, we examine the effects of X on Y."

In summary, mastering the use of tense and person in academic writing enhances clarity and ensures that the research is presented professionally.
