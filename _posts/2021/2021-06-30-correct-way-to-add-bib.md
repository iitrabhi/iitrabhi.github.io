# The problem 

I have 100's of references in my zotero library. When I bring them to my `bib` file it ends up in a mess. There are many unwanted keys and there is no order to the references therein. This is the workflow that I have developed to handle the problem

# Workflow

- **Better bibtex: **Use better bibtex plugin to clean up the export in zotero. After installation of the plugin, you can set the fields to omit. Goto `Preferences ->Better Bibtex -> Export `

- **BibTeX Tidy: ** This website is excellent to beautify your bib file and clean up further. I use it to have proper indentation in my bib file and also to sort the enteries by year.
