## The problem 

I have used the `moving` theme to develop my jekyll website for this year. Next year I wish to make this website more personal and thus add custom layouts and pages. For that I need to develop the website locally on my computer and once I feel good with it I can push it to the world. In the process I also wish to learn `Javascript` development.

## The Solution

- **Start by making a new branch for the website.** This way I could do all the devleopment and still keep on posting blog posts on my main website.
- **Then install Jekyll** : This could be done by going to the [official website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) and follow along the instructions.
- **Follow the Quickstart guide** :`cd` into the source repo and follow along the [quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) guide to start the local server. The website would then be hosted on `http://localhost:4000/`
- **Happy coding**: Now any changes to the source files would result in change in the local build. Once satisfied, I can merge back my changes to the `main` branch.
