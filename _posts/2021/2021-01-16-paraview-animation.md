Here are my steps to create a video file of the animation from Paraview.

- Select the proper color code and position of the plot in Paraview.  Paraview will export the animation as it is presented on the application

- Now goto File  â†’  Save Animation and save the animation  into a folder of your choice. Save the animation as `.png` images.

- This will create a new project on your computer. Next, drag and drop all the images that you have exported from Paraview into the `Project library` area.

- Select all the images in timeline by pressing `Ctrl + A` on your keyboard twice. Now, click on the duration button and change the duration of each image to $$\frac{1}{frame-rate} seconds$$. That is if you want the frame-rate to be 20 fps then the image duration will be 1/20. ![image-20210116144612334](/assets/images/image-20210116144612334.png) 

- That is it. Now you can click on `Finish video` on top right and export the video.![image-20210116144720280](/assets/images/image-20210116144720280.png)
