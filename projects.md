# Projects

Some of my projects (or that I have contributed to):

- [**FEniCS**](https://fenicsproject.org/): It's an awesome open-source package to solve differential equations using the finite element method. I was luck enough to get accepted in the google summer of code to work on the mesh processing pipeline in the new version of FEniCS, tag named FEniCS-X. You can find more about my experience [here](https://computationalmechanics.in/fenics-the-mesh-workflow/). I was also interview by numfocus during GSoC and you can find that [here](https://numfocus.org/blog/meet-our-2019-gsoc-students-part-1). The output of the program is mentioned on the google-summer-of-code website [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4659097339691008).

- [**meshio**](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio): We use meshio everyweek to convert models between different mesh type. The package is designed by [Nico Schlomer](https://twitter.com/nschloe) who has been my inspiration in the world of scientific computing. During the GSoC program, I had an assignement  to add some functionallity to the `meshio ` package. The PR for that is [here](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio/pull/425). So happy that the PR was upto his standards and got merged into the packageðŸ˜Š.
